# Version 1
## Code

Source Arduino code gathered from: https://github.com/spenceraxani/CosmicWatch-Desktop-Muon-Detector-v2

This code was taken directly from Spencer Axani and the CosmicWatch Muon Detector. It is capable of EITHER displaying to the OLED or writing to the SD card. We were mainly unsatisfied with its capabilities: we wanted altimeter support to confirm the Pfotzer curve, as well as for it to both be displayed on the screen and written to the SD card. This was resolved in Version 2.

## Hardware

For the hardware, our PCB and Scintillator were followed near-identically (except for its tuning) from the repository. The case was cut from a differently sized styrofoam box, and we tried adding a polycarbonate window. This proved to be too heavy, and posed potential adhesion issues. Therefore, it was also scrapped. A camera mount was CADed as well.

Simiarily, a shell for the PCB was also designed, but then removed, since it was not only too heavy, but inhibited the access to sensors.
