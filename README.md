# Muon Watcher

A Hackclub Apex project by Brian Zhang, Daniel Zhang, and Eugene Lee

## Project Motivation

In Physics, a prominent example of special relativity used is the Muon; a particle that travels at high enough speeds to experience relativistic effects. This project aims to observe time dilation in muons, utilizing scintillators and sensors to detect the change in rate of muons detected. The project hopes to confirm / explore the Pfotzer maximum, where experimentation and theory have shown that a maximal rate of particle detection occurs at ~29km.

## Project outline

We initially expected that the relativistic effects would mean that a larger rate would be observed at the bottom, and a lesser upwards, but sources such as
https://www.unco.edu/nhs/physics-astronomy/pdf/2018CSGCEclipse.pdf
show that there exists a particular curve for this data, the Pfotzer curve. Thus, this experiment intends to not only observe the Muons themselves, but also whether if the Pfotzer curve exists in our own experimentation

Muon detection is done through the CosmicWatch Desktop Muon Detector (https://github.com/spenceraxani/CosmicWatch-Desktop-Muon-Detector-v2), to which it will be modified to include other sensors.
